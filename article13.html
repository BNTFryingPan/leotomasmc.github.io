    <body class="c0"><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You may have heard of Article 13. Article 13 is a law that the EU (European Union) is trying to get passed. You may think that this won&rsquo;t affect you, but it will. Article 13 as a concept is perfectly fine. The law is trying to help improve copyright laws in the EU, however the way they the law is written poses a problem. The problem is that it will cause many content creators to no longer be able to upload content to platforms such at YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, and many other sites. Websites such as YouTube would be forced to treat everyone under this law, no matter where they live, or have people who live in the EU see different content. This would cause content creators such as PewDiePie, JackSepticEye, and other content creators in countries in the EU to no longer be able to upload content due to this law. This would also cause many memes to die and be more dead than Uganda Knuckles. Please tell other people about this issue, and if you know anyone who live in a country that is part of the EU, tell them about this. I would suggest watching this video by MatPat from GameTheroy and FilmTheroy as it explains this very well.
